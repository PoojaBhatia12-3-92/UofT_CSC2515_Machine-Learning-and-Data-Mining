Here is Python code:

       Performs gradient descent to learn theta
    """
    m = y.size  # number of training examples
    for i in range(num_iters):

        theta = theta - alpha * (1.0/m) * np.dot(X.T, y_hat-y)
    return theta



train_x =x[0:int(((0.7))*n)]
train_y =y[0:int((0.7)*n)]
test_x=x[int((0.7)*n):n]
test_y=y[int((0.7)*n):n]
